<p>Our work has been presented in the Information Systems Education
&amp; Curricula Workshop (ISEC’13).</p>
<p>ISEC goal is to promote the discussion about the convergence between
Computer Science and Information Systems topics, so that researchers can
present a complete and detailed specification of their educational
curricula by means of these two topics. We inspect papers that
contribute to the better understanding of emerging and important
educational fields of Computer Science (CS) and Information Systems
(IS). Authors are invited to submit their papers in English, presenting
the results of original research or innovative practical applications in
the field.</p>
<p>In our propossal is shown how during the last decade there has been a
shift in the way learning process is conducted. One of the main reasons
is that technology is changing. Due to this fast movement, concepts like
“class”, “workgroup” and “learning process” are changing too. Learning
processes are going beyond the boundaries of what was known as “class”.
Face-to-face models get mixed with online environments where students
are remotely connected through the Internet. This new approach is called
blended learning, and it is aimed at improving learning as well as
bringing learning where it was impossible or complicated. Nevertheless,
one of the main issues is that teachers need innovative tools that
support these different learning models.</p>
<p>As a consequence, this work is focused on the development of a tool
for dealing with the main issues found in blended learning scenarios. It
is divided in three phases. First, the blended learning experiences and
models of the last decade are reviewed. In a second phase, a tool called
Drawer, for supporting the main features of the design and use of
blended learning experience is developed. In the last phase, an
evaluation is made to assess the outcomes of the new tool.</p>
